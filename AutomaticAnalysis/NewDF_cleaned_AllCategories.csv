348,349,"profile: remove redundant code in DiveCalculatedCeiling The DiveCalculatedCeiling profile-item has a recalc() function, which calls ""dataModel->calculateDecompression()"". This is a questionable reversal of control-flow: The profile-item should paint the model-data not change it. The code was supposed to be called under two conditions: 1) The value of the calcceiling3m preferences flag changed. This code was buggy for two reasons: Firstly, the cached value was always initialized to false, which means that sometimes the first call was missed. Secondly, the settingsChanged() functions was only called when closing the preferences window, not when changing the flag in the profile widgets. 2) The datetime of the dive changed. The whole control-flow is pretty absurd (due to ""bit rot""): - The replan-dive command sends a date-time changed signal. - The main tab changes the date-time and informs the profile. - The profile sends a signal to the item. - The item instructs the model to recalculate the decompression. - The model causes the profile to be redrawn. In any case, the whole thing is moot, because the decompression is recalculated for *every* profile plot in create_plot_info_new(). Let's remove the code from the DiveCalculatedCeiling profile-item and the calculateDecompression() function, which is now not used anymore.

467,468,"Undo: implement undo of dive site editing This one is a bit more tricky. There are two modes: set dive site and set newly created dive site. This is realized using an OO model with derived classed. Quite convoluted - but it seems to work. Moreover, editing a dive site is not simply setting a value, but the list of dives in a dive site has to be kept up to date. Finally, we have to inform the dive site list of the changed number of dives. Therefore add a new signal diveSiteDivesChanged. To send only one signal per dive site, hook into the undo() and redo() functions and call the functions of the base class there.

705,706,"Fixed handling of Image/Info URL files. The files image_url.dat and info_url.dat contain data for web links attached to the popup menus of various objects. The first time KStars is run, the globally-installed files are copied into the user's KDEHOME directory, so they are free to add/modify/remove links as they see fit. However, this means that if the global version of the file is updated, the user will not see the updates, because KStars only looks at the global file if the local file does not exist. This is now fixed. KStarsData::openURLFile() compares the timestamps of the global and local versions. If the global version is newer, then it is checked for new or duplicate lines. When checking lines, only the object-name and text-label fields are considered, not the URL itself. This is done so that if a link's URL is updated, it is still considered a duplicate of the original line. New lines in the global file are appended to the local file. When duplicate lines are found, the line from the global file replaces the line in the local file. Please test this on your system using the recently updated image_url.dat. Before running kstars, your local image_url.dat should have ~440 lines. Afterwards, it should have ~650 lines.

We use a UUID library and call `uuidv1`, which despite being timestamp based, would happily go over 16 bytes even though we supply with a Buffer.alloc(16). After cutting off, we occasionally get duplicasted opID. Possibly due to the way uuidv1 is formatted, this happens pretty often. It's a problem when we have multiple RPCs going on. Visible issue isone can get another's opID removed from inProgress when SimpleFSWait is called. This is why occasionally draging/dropping many files results in error on some but not all files. It's also why sometimes error happens after creating a new folder in GUI, which is what this ticket was originally about. We do a folderListLoad after creating succeeds because historically we didn't have notifications when folder content changed and we just reloaded everytime we changed something. Now that we have notifications, notifications cause such loads too. So multiple folerListLoad can happen concurrently and when unforutnate duplicaste opID happen. It's more likely to happen when multiple folder creations happen together. Apparently we should avoid loading after successfully creating a folder now that we have notifications, but that's a separate issue which I'll have another PR. * just mod (36^4) , https://github.com/keybase/client",CODE

I also noticed that in the new FOV dialog, the word ""length"" appreaed as ""lengt"" only, I thought first it was a type but when I opened the ui file, it wasn't a type but rather a layout issue. Since different users have different font and resolution settings, it's better to encapsulate all widgets in layouts. The new ui can grow/shrink in size without problem in Qt designer. However, because FOVDialog is a child of KDialogBase, the shrinking of the FOV ui is not as pretty. This shrinking problem exists with the old ui as well. The FOV feature is great Jason! When I created a new FOV and then switched to it from the menu, I sort of expected KStars to zoom to the new FOV for the current focus in the skymap (or center). The zoom should be a little larger than the FOV symbol itself so the user can see the symbol. If a user switches to very small FOV (like that of HST), they don't know the change because the symbol is tiny, so maybe the autozoom when switching FOVs would resolve that issue as well.

This means that if a VPN profile had stored a literal certificate instead of a base64-encoded certificate (as was the case in <= 0.7), it might get decoded into junk data. Through experimentation and reading the source code, it was shown that inputs like ""a&bc"" or ""ab*c"" do not raise exceptions. So we will add a regexp to reject any base64 string with invalid characters. At the minimum this should cause PEM files starting with ""-----BEGIN "" to be processed as literal values, not as base64.
